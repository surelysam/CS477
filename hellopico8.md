# Hello PICO-8: Learning the basics

A PICO-8 cartridge that already exists can be loaded into your PICO-8 environment using a few methods, one method is finding the cartridge number and loading it directly in the command prompt.  
**Navigating:** ESC will bring up the command prompt.

Another method is pasting the code, and then executing run in the command prompt. We can reach the code editing environment by clicking 'esc'.  
**Navigating:** ESC will bring up the command prompt, then pressing ESC again will bring you to the coding environment. Once done there you can press ESC to get back to the command prompt, then RUN to run the code just typed.

This code editing environment is where we will do all out programming. Here's an example of running a "Hello World" program.  
**Navigating:** ESC will bring up the command prompt, then pressing ESC again will bring you to the coding environment. Once done there you can press ESC to get back to the command prompt, then RUN to run the code just typed.

Other PICO-8 cartridges can be accessed directly in the interface. By typing 'Splore' we can view a variety of categories to play games from.  
**Navigating:** ESC will bring up the command prompt, then SPLORE will take you to the explore menus. Right, Left, and Enter on the keyboard can be used for navigating and executing commands.

PICO-8 will create the directory in User/AppData/ by default, this can be updated in the config file.
